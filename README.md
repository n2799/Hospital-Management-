assignment 2: 

**Problem Statement: **You are tasked with designing a hospital's system to manage patient records. The system should allow for efficient retrieval, updating, and removal of patient records while ensuring data integrity and privacy.

​

**Example Usage Scenario: **A patient arrives at the hospital and provides their details at the registration desk. The receptionist adds the patient to the system, assigns them a unique identifier, and schedules an appointment with a doctor. The patient's details are added to the queue for consultation. The doctor updates the patient's medical record during the consultation and issues a prescription. The prescription is added to the stack of prescriptions for record-keeping. Once the consultation is complete, the patient's record is updated and removed from the consultation queue.

​

Requirements:

Implement the patient record management system using various data structures to represent patient records.
Use all the data structures taught in class, such as lists, arrays, singly and doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, and classes, to achieve the following aspects of the system:
Store patient records in a simple, organized format.
Efficiently store patient records when the size is known in advance.
Maintain a line of patients waiting for consultations.
Organize patient records in a sorted manner based on their medical condition or admission date.
Manage medical prescriptions issued to patients during consultation.
Schedule patient appointments with doctors.
Represent the entities involved, e.g., patients, doctors, prescriptions, and the hospital.
Implement the following functionalities in the patient record management system:
Add a new patient record, including personal details, medical history, and current condition.
Update an existing patient record with new information or medical updates.
Remove a patient record from the queue upon discharge or transfer to another facility.
Schedule an appointment for a patient with a specific doctor.
Manage the line of patients waiting for consultation, ensuring FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.
Issue medical prescriptions to patients during consultation and manage the stack of prescriptions.
Search for a patient and display a summary including their personal details, the doctor who will attend to them, their appointment details, and their medications.
Ensure that patient data is securely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel.
Test the system thoroughly to ensure its functionality and efficiency.
Deliverables:

Implement the patient record management system using Python or any programming language you choose.
A menu-based interface that demonstrates how the system works, including getting the required inputs and displaying the specified outputs.
Documentation detailing the design, functionality, and usage of each data structure implemented in the system.
Test cases demonstrating the correctness and efficiency of the system.
We do not recommend it, but you can use AI tools to help you. However, you must thoroughly understand the code produced. You also may only use data structures up to what you were taught. You should expect to be asked about any solutions submitted, and if you need help understanding them, unfortunately, points will be taken off.
Please store your code on GitHub. Make sure you continuously add commits to your code, and that has to include all team members.
